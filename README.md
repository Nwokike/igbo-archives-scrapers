# Igbo Archives Scrapers

This repository contains the Python extraction scripts for the **Igbo Archives** data collection project. These scripts are engineered to be modular, robust, and maintainable, serving as the ingestion engine for the Igbo Archives API.

> **Note:** This repository contains **only the scraper code**. The datasets generated by these scripts are stored in dedicated, separate repositories on Hugging Face.

### 🏛️ Project Philosophy: Code vs. Data

To ensure ethical usage and clear copyright boundaries, this project strictly separates the **Extraction Logic** from the **Archival Content**.

* **THE CODE (This Repo):**
    * **Purpose:** Tools to index and standardize cultural heritage data.
    * **License:** Open Source (Apache 2.0). You are free to audit, modify, and contribute to the logic.

* **THE DATA (Hugging Face):**
    * **Contents:** JSONL metadata, image binaries, and audio files.
    * **License:** **Strictly governed by the original source.**
    * *Example:* Data from the MAA Cambridge is subject to their specific terms (e.g., CC BY-NC-ND 4.0). Each dataset includes a specific `README.md` detailing these rights.

### 🛠️ Installation & Prerequisites

This project uses modern web automation tools (Playwright) to handle dynamic archives.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Nwokike/igbo-archives-scrapers.git](https://github.com/Nwokike/igbo-archives-scrapers.git)
    cd igbo-archives-scrapers
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install Browser Drivers:**
    The MAA scraper requires the Chromium driver to render JavaScript-heavy pages.
    ```bash
    playwright install chromium
    ```

### ⚙️ Usage Guide

Each scraper is designed to be run as a standalone process.

1.  **Navigate to the scrapers directory:**
    ```bash
    cd scrapers
    ```

2.  **Run a specific scraper:**
    ```bash
    # Example: Run the MAA Cambridge scraper
    python run_maa_cambridge.py
    ```

3.  **Authentication (Hugging Face):**
    * The script will prompt you for your Hugging Face **WRITE** token (if not found in environment variables).
    * It will automatically processing the data: `Scrape` -> `Clean/Validate` -> `Upload`.

### 🤝 Contributing & Extending

To add a new archive source:

1.  **Template:** Use `scrapers/run_maa_cambridge.py` as your base template (it includes the latest Playwright async logic).
2.  **Schema:** Ensure your output dictionary strictly matches the project's `schema_v1` (Title, IDNO, Description, Date, Source URL).
3.  **Separation:** Do not hardcode image binaries into the JSON. Save images to a local folder and link them via filenames.
